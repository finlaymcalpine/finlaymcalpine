- Hi, Iâ€™m @finlaymcalpine

- I'm an economist who's interested in working with macro and financial market data to inform policy and drive decisions across the macroeconomic sphere.
- For me, though, GitHub is where I mess about with personal projects: to get better at R, to learn Python, and to avoid marathon training.
- I'm always looking to work on new pet projects and to improve my coding/data science skills. Reach out if you're interested in working with me!
