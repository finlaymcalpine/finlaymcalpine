- Hi, Iâ€™m @finlaymcalpine

- I'm an economist/data scientist interested in working with macro and financial market data to inform decision-making.
- For me, though, GitHub is where I'll mess about with personal projects: to get better at Python (and delve into Rust), to learn more about data science, and to avoid marathon training!
