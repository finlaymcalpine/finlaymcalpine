- Hi, Iâ€™m @finlaymcalpine

- I'm an economist/data scientist who's interested in working with macro and financial market data to inform decision-making across the macroeconomic space.
- For me, though, GitHub is where I'll mess about with personal projects: to get better at R & Python, to learn more about data science, and to avoid marathon training!
- I'm always looking to work on new pet projects and to improve my programming/data science skills. Reach out if you're interested in working with me!
